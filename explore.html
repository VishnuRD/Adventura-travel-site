 <h1>Kerala</h1> <br>
 <p class="para">There is no exaggeration in Kerala’s status as ‘God’s own country’, for how else does one explain its gorgeous 600-kilometre stretch of undisturbed coastline skirting the Arabian Sea, the palm-fringed beaches, a network of languid backwaters home to a vibrant rural life, the misty tea-covered Western Ghats, wildlife reserves teeming with endemic flora and fauna and spice plantations running rampant on its valleys and hill slopes.One of the country’s cleanest states, and perhaps the friendliest too, it is an absolute delight travelling around, visiting the historical temples and museums in Trivandrum, getting a slice of the maritime history in Cochin (Kochi) or taking a boat ride to islands like Mattancherry to trace its Jewish roots.Add to it a culture that is defined by colourful folk art and dance forms, a cuisine that is subtle yet generous in its use of spices, and a passion for Ayurveda that promises to soothe frazzled nerves. Simply slacken your stride and let all its sights and smell envelop you.</p>

<h1>Maldives</h1> <br>
<p class="para">Maldives is the love child of pristine white beaches and extravagant hospitality. One of the reasons why the island country is considered to be the best destination for honeymooners is because of the romantic ambiance that it spews. With its posh resorts, exquisite water villas, colourful reefs and water that's bluer than blue, Maldives certainly makes for one of the ideal places to visit.The cluster of exotic islands further make it postcard-worthy for your travelogue. The Maldives island nation is a cluster of precious jewels – discovering each of them is a pleasure and delight. Start with Malé – the capital city. Thrumming with energy, this is a city filled with beautiful buildings, like the 17th century Friday Mosque, energetic markets like Male Market and the lovely Mulee aage Palace. Cross the sparkling waters that surround Male and you’ll arrive at the Hulhumale Island, with its spectacular beaches, glass topped mosque, a beautiful promenade and serene, green neighbourhoods. If you’re going slightly off the well-trodden path, then Maafushi is the destination to visit. Once ravaged by the tsunami, this island is climbing back on its feet, with a variety of beautiful resorts springing up. This is a quiet, beautiful pocket of the world to tuck yourself into. Stroll on the beaches, laze at the guesthouse and enjoy coffee at its small coffeehouses. For a little history, head to the northernmost of the Maldivian island chains to the island of Utheemu – once the home of Sultan Mohammed Thakurufaanu, the leader who drove the Portuguese invaders from the islands in the 16th century. Other places to visit are Feydhoo, Maradhoo, Veligandu Island, Banana Reef, Thulusdhoo Island and more.</p>
